                    <h2>Who I Am: A Brief Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! I'm Anirudh kumar , currently a student at Singapore Polytechnic doing Cyber security and digital forensics but past that I harbor a growing passion for eco-conscious living and discovering practical, everyday ways to reduce my environmental footprint. <p>
                    <p>I'm a firm believer that a series of small, consistent changes can ripple outwards to create significant positive impacts. This space is where I'll share my journey, the lessons I learn, the challenges I encounter, and the innovative "green hacks" I've learnt . Join me as I explore this path!</p>

            <h2>My Spark: The Passion for Eco-Friendly Living</h2>
            <p>My journey into sustainability was sparked when <strong>I had my first experience raising a plant, as I watched that potted plant slowly grow i started to learn and admire about the beauty of nature, and i soon began to realise that our habits of unsustainable living has been destroying this beauty that I had just discovered.</strong> This pivotal moment urged me to critically examine our collective consumption habits and the profound impact they have on the health of our planet.</p>
            <p>The Zero Waste philosophy particularly resonates with me because it’s both actionable and empowering. It’s not about attaining an elusive state of perfection, but rather about cultivating greater consciousness and intentionality in our daily lives. I find immense joy in discovering creative, resourceful solutions to common waste problems and sharing these insights with others. For me, eco-friendly living is a continuous journey of aligning my everyday actions with my core values of respect for nature, responsibility for our shared resources, and hope for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Milestones & Goals: My Experiences with Waste Reduction</h2>
            <p>My path towards a lower-impact lifestyle is an ongoing exploration, filled with learning and adaptation. Here are a few key areas where I've begun to make tangible changes and the insights gained:</p>
            <ul class="experience-list"> <!-- Unordered list to itemize experiences -->
                <li><strong>Conquering Kitchen Waste:</strong> Implementing meal planning to prevent food spoilage, using reusable food wraps (like beeswax wraps) over cling film, and choosing produce with minimal or no packaging.</li>
                <li><strong>DIY & Natural Cleaning Solutions:</strong> Experimenting with simple, effective recipes for all-purpose cleaners using ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon. This has significantly reduced my reliance on harsh chemicals and single-use plastic bottles.</li>
                <li><strong>The Art of Conscious Shopping:</strong> Prioritizing secondhand items, especially for clothing, books, and household goods. Making a deliberate effort to support local businesses that demonstrate sustainable practices and, of course, never leaving home without a reusable shopping bag (or three!).</li>
                <li><strong>Tackling Digital Clutter:</strong> Regularly unsubscribing from unnecessary email newsletters and being mindful of digital consumption. It's a surprising realization that even our digital footprint (server energy, e-waste) has an environmental cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Learning & Advocacy:</strong> Actively reading articles, following inspiring zero-waste advocates, and engaging in open conversations about these topics with friends and family to gently spread awareness and share practical tips.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="content-section green-hacks-section animated-section fade-in-up" style="--animation-delay: 0.45s;">
            <h2>My Favourite "Green Hacks": Simple Swaps, Big Impact</h2>
            <p>Here are a couple of simple yet remarkably effective "green hacks" that I've incorporated into my routine and genuinely champion:</p>

                <article class="hack-card"> <!-- First hack card -->
                    <img src="ZERO_WASTE_SITE/assets/images/Green_onions.jpg" alt="Green onions regrowing from scraps in a jar of water"> <!-- Image from :- https://foodgardening.mequoda.com/articles/regrowing-green-onions-carrot-greens-and-celery-in-water/-->
                    <div class="hack-content"> <!-- Content area for the hack card -->
                        <h3>Hack 1: The Perpetual Veggie Patch (Regrowing Scraps)</h3>
                        <p><strong>The What:</strong> Placing the root ends of vegetables like green onions, celery, lettuce, leeks, or even pineapple tops in a shallow dish of water to regrow them. It's astonishing how quickly they sprout new life!</p>
                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This simple act significantly reduces food waste, offers a small but satisfying saving on groceries, and provides the sheer joy of harvesting your own "free" produce. It's also a fantastic visual reminder of nature's resilience and a fun, educational experiment for all ages.</p>

                    <div class="hack-content"> <!-- Content area for the hack card -->
                        <h3>Hack 2: Coffee Grounds Gold (Repurposing Brewed Grounds)</h3>
                        <p><strong>The What:</strong> Instead of immediately discarding used coffee grounds, I save them for a multitude of uses. They can be a gentle exfoliating scrub (mixed with a bit of coconut oil or body wash), a nitrogen-rich natural fertilizer for acid-loving plants, a dye, or even an effective odor absorber in the fridge or compost bin.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> It gives a valuable second life to what many consider waste. It's an incredibly easy way to reduce what goes to landfill and extract extra utility. My plants certainly seem to appreciate the boost, and it's a great conversation starter about creative reuse!</p>
